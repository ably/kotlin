## Overview

Welcome to Ably's new home for pure Kotlin source code, being incubated by our very own SDK Team. :rocket:

This early stage repository:

- does not contain any source code that directly produces a client library or SDK (yet :wink:)
- will always manage, as primary content, pure Kotlin source code
- will publish project(s) to Maven Central under `com.ably` (_not_ `io.ably`)
- has, initially, been created to assist us in breaking out Ably-shared components from [our Asset Tracking Android SDKs](https://github.com/ably/ably-asset-tracking-android)
- will, eventually, start contributing dependencies for [our core Java SDK](https://github.com/ably/ably-java/)

## Contributing
